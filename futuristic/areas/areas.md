## `grid.Lumina` – Digital 1

_The starting digital zone, bright and streamlined. Introduces the core systems of movement, interface, and Aevum’s presence in daily life._

## `grid.Nexis` – Digital 2

_Combat-focused district pulsing with activity and rising Aevum control. Tactical layout and denser node clustering highlight progression._

## `root.Meridell` – Physical 1

_A serene, nature-infused region rich with water and warm hotspring atmospheres. A soft entry into the physical world’s magic-tinged reality._

## `grid.Cyphra` – Digital 3

_A colder, more calculated grid overtaken by Aevum’s experiments. Players begin seeing stronger distortions and tighter digital control._

## `root.Mirage` – Physical 2

_An elusive region filled with strange natural phenomena. Mirage-like visuals and warped terrain hint at the magic vs. code conflict bleeding in._

## `root.Eldara` – Physical 3

_Ancient, forgotten lands where the magic of the physical realm is strongest. Crumbling ruins and arcane echoes dominate this mystical domain._

> Includes a concealed entrance to `frx.Quanta裂`, a hybrid fracture zone of merged realities.

## `grid.Softlock` – Digital 4 (extended)

_A towering digital megastructure leading to Aevum’s heart. Fully industrialized and locked-down. Acts as the game's longest region, with high stakes and climactic pacing._

## `sys.Softlock` – Final Area

_A pristine, eerie void at the top of Aevum’s system. No areas—just a throne of silence, data, and finality. The end._

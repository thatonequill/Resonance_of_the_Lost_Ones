# Regions

## Tutorial - `grid.Flatlight`

* `node.SlabStreet` — Basic city streets to get familiar with the digital environment.
* `echo.Failsafe` — Echoes' safe haven and hideout, a secure base for resistance.
* `echo.Recompile` — Training chamber and practice ground within the Echoes' domain.

> **Transition:** `trans.SignalBleed` — The initial digital signal fracture as you move deeper into Aevum’s city.

## `grid.Lumina` – Digital 1

*The starting digital zone, bright and streamlined. Introduces core systems of movement, interface, and Aevum’s presence in daily life. Residential district.*

* Optional: `exo.*` (various side nodes and explorables)

> **Transition:** `trans.MemoryLeak` — A minor system instability signaling a shift in control.

## `grid.Nexis` – Digital 2

*Combat-focused district pulsing with activity and rising Aevum control. Tactical layout and denser node clustering highlight progression. More Security district.*

## `grid.Cyphra` – Digital 3

*A colder, more calculated grid overtaken by Aevum’s experiments. Players begin seeing stronger distortions and tighter digital control.*

* Optional: `exo.*`
* Starts by reconnecting with `echo.Failsafe` for story beats and upgrades.

> **Null Void:** `null_void.DivideSignal` — A fracture in reality marking a split between worlds, tension rises.

---

## `root.Mirage` – Verdarch 2

*An elusive region filled with strange natural phenomena. Mirage-like visuals and warped terrain hint at the magic vs. code conflict bleeding in.*

* Optional: `exo.*`

> **Transition:** `trans.AetherPass` — Crossing a threshold between Verdarch terrains, warped and magical energy flows.

## `root.Eldara` – Verdarch 3

*Ancient, forgotten lands where the magic of the Meatspace is strongest. Crumbling ruins and arcane echoes dominate this mystical domain.*

* Optional: `exo.*`
* Contains the hidden gateway to the fracture zone

> **Null Void:** `null_void.虚空基盤界 (Kokū Kiban Kai)` — "Void Foundation Realm," barrier between pure magic and digital intrusion.
> **Null Void:** `null_void.TerminalShift` — Final passage out of the Verdarch realm into the core of Aevum’s systems.

## `frx.Quanta裂` – Hybrid Fracture Region

*A chaotic convergence where the Glasspace and Verdarch magic collide and warp. Reality is unstable, blending the two realms in unpredictable ways.*

* Optional: `exo.*`
* Features unique hybrid enemies and special bosses (`blk.`)

> **Null Void:** `null_void.TerminalShift` — Exit point leading into the Coreplex, the heart of Aevum’s digital domain.

---

## `grid.Coreplex` – Digital 4 (extended)

*A towering digital megastructure leading to Aevum’s heart. Fully industrialized and locked-down. Acts as the game's longest region, with high stakes and climactic pacing.*

* Optional: `exo.*`

> **Transition:** `trans.LastPing` — The last digital echo before the ultimate confrontation.

## `sys.Softlock` – Final Area

*A pristine, eerie void at the top of Aevum’s system. No areas—just a throne of silence, data, and finality. The end.*

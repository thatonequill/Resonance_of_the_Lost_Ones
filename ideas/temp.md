(Names for the hero / resonating soul / enemies are yet to be decided)

# Resonance of the Lost Ones
is a game where the hero find herself in a land deprived of most human life, only souls of past sinners left to be forgotten. She stumbles upon a soul that deeply resonate with her, and finds that she needs to help that very soul repent itself for her to be freed. 


### Main idea and objective
The player is first introduced to the game's 'normal' mechanic with simple puzzles / platforming / combat before finding the resonating soul. The game is in top down view, with puzzle / platforming parts in 2D, with the fights yet to be decided.
Upon finding the resonating soul, the player is then introduced to the gimmick of the game, ghost gameplay. The player fuses with the soul, then allowing to enter the soul's dimension, dimension vaguely resembling the world of the livings, but with obstacles being removed or added, new npc's, objects, enemies and so on. 
To progress the game, the player must find and help lost souls by doing various task related to their story and how they died. They could be fights and/or platforming tests, fetching quest items by talking to others etc.
Souls of the Renowned are to be expected, being the mission givers for the bossfights.
You have to clear the main bosses, with optional bosses (at least a true final boss) to get a true ending.
The game will be organised as areas with 3 or 5 main ones (tbd).
I aim to have 2 optional ones, maybe more but I would then have 2 big ones and the rest be smaller ones.

### Difficulty
Since I want the game not to be easy, I really want to add a healing feature, but with 2 potion types, a ghost healing and a normal healing. if the player drinks the normal potion while in ghost form, he will take damage and vice versa, making the player have to take in account which form he has, if he should buy ghost or normal potions etc.

- Platforming, I want it to be hard but fair, with maybe celest like movement.
- Combats will maybe be turn based for 'regular' enemies with action to choose and stats like `health / endurance / swiftness / mana(?) / strength / agility / intelligence(?)` to add personalisation to the gameplay.
- Bossfights, I do not want repetitiveness and have them like the regular fights. I want them to feel unique and create a rush in adrenaline to the player when encountering them for the first time. To achive this, I want to make it a 2D platformer and bossfight with the same weapons as regular fights, but now with skill instead of stat based luck.

- ### Gameplay

Gameplay will be divided in 4 distinct parts
- Map exploration, top down view, like undertale / deltarune. Enemies and traps are spread on the map, with enemies moving around slightly, some might follow and chase, while other might flee. Puzzles will be in this mode.
- Combat, in an rpg like style, what else to say
- Exploration challenges, celest like gameplay (at least in gameplay feel), classic 2D hard platforming
- Bossfights, like the Exploration challenges are going to be in that side view with 2d platformer elements, with add combat like swords, bows and staffs (magic is tbd if it's going to be added)

During map exploration, the player will use wasd or ↑←↓→ to move and space to interact, maybe use the mouse to point and move with right click to interact, depending on how hard it is to implement.
Pressing the shift key (L or R) will trigger the ghost form.

One of the key elements of gameplay is the game being in 2 dimensions (within the 2D plan) the normal dimension and the ghost dimension.
The difference in both dimensions resides in changes in the environment like door / walls / obstacles moving around or disappearing entirely.
Enemies also change. While enemies are rarer in the normal dimension they are tankier and slower, they are more abundant and and faster to move around in the ghost dimension.
The player is also faster in the ghost dimension, giving a risk/reward to those who aspire to move swiftly.

Expending on the exploration challenges, I want basic platformer functions, with the added ghost element instead of a dash. While in ghost form, the player will have access to a dash, would fall slower, allowing to clear wider gaps and be less affected by wind (if added). The ghost dimension would be the same, having different obstacles and requiring the player to switch from regular to ghost form, allowing to do some pretty 'hard to pull off' tricks with having to switch from regular to ghost back and forth to clear areas.

Combat will be classic turn based rpg.

Bossfight will use the same platforming elements while also adding combat mechanics, with using weapons, dodging, weakpoints and prehaps more.

# main questline & gameplay loop idea

Top down view

The player wakes up in an old and somewhat destroyed house, looking around confused, grabbing his stuff, introducing looting and chests. He gathers a torch, a cloak, some coins hidden around the house, some food and herbs for healing and leveling up.
If he so choose to, the player can search and find a somewhat hidden access to the attic.
The attic will have a platforming challenge, as an intro to the 2D platforming aspect of the game.
If he manages to get to the chest he'll receive an actual sword, making the early fights easier.
**I am still unsure on wether I make the attic optional or not**
He then will be prompted to leave the house, if he tries prior to getting his stuff, he won't be able to leave.

### outside

I want a light system, with areas having limited visions and others not, requiring a torch to see in a small area around the player. Unlit areas are not pitch black, but hard to distinguish details in, with chests and others thing of interest like it hidden :3
The early stages will just have the player go around in a dead town, trying to find anyone.
Upon knocking on a set amount of house doors or trying to leave the city the player will be contacted by the Resonating Soul, prompting him to find her and go deeper in the forest in search of an old tower.

While going through the forest, the player will have to fight wildlife, introducing combat.

## ASSUMING I DO CRAFTING
The player will then acquire different materials, as well as experience points. 
Upon leveling up, the player will be introduced to the level up tab from the inventory, which is locked prior to this moment (Yes if the player finds a way to never level up he can finish the game without unlocking the tab).

The player will then find the tower, in the other side of a ravin, making the player go through a new 2D part. The player then reaches the tower, getting inside in 2D platform before going deeper in top down map.

## Ghost form introduction

The player then reaches the Resonating Soul, after some lore dialogue (boring ik) they both fuse into one (changing the heart ui).
The player then goes through a tutorial, showing that both worlds are similar, but different.
Some obstacles move, disappear or appear. 
Upon moving deeper in the tower, the player will stumble upon a crafting table, if added and only in ghost form.

The player will then be prompted to go even deeper and meet Johnny Depp, the first soul in need, introducing Broken Spirits.

The Broken Spirit will then send the player on a quest tbd that will reflect the quest they were on when they perished. Completing the quest will unlock a secret passage, allowing the player to go through the next area, leaving the tutorial.

Donny Jeph will be his name, and the quest shall be to fight the first mini boss, a named enemy. Jeremy will be an armored skelly outside the tower, challenging the player in a classic fight (turn based yady yada).

### Main quest and how quests work

The hero wakes up, the house he's in being in a rough shape, and tries to find help, unable to do so. He then stumbles on a lost soul, the Resonating Soul. The Resonating Soul then tells the hero she can help him, but she needs his help before being able to do so. The hero then starts his journey to help the Resonating Soul, going on a quest to help souls leave this cursed land. The hero will have to help various souls, souls divided in 3 categories: Broken Spirits, commoners of this land sending the player on classic fight, mini boss fight or fetching (parkour related) quests; Souls of the Renowned, rarer and much stronger souls sending the player on boss fight quests; Atonement of the Condemned, much darker souls sending the player on optional boss fight quests.

Upon finishing the required quests, the player will earn the ending, while he earns the true ending for finishing all the quest. A "true ending with added sparkles" will be obtainable for doing the true ending, but with ✨ *Le stick* ✨
